A shipment represents a grouping of order line items that you can ship to a customer.\\n\\nThe V2 Shipping API allows you to manage shipping zones, shipping methods, and shipping carrier connections.\\n\\nThe Order Shipments resource creates a shipment for an order. You can specify the shipping provider, tracking number, and shipping address ID when creating a shipment.\\n\\nCheckout APIs\\n\\nThe REST Storefront, GraphQL Storefront, and REST Management APIs provide methods for managing a checkout up until the point when you finalized it into an order. Because you can only create shipments from finalized orders, you cannot create a shipment from Checkout API endpoints.\\n\\nHowever, all of the listed APIs provide methods for creating a consignment that specifies the line items that should ship to a particular address. Creating a consignment corresponds with the actions that a shopper might take when filling out the storefront checkout page and assigning the items in their basket to their respective shipping destinations.\\n\\nA checkout will always have one consignment assigned to it, which is the first shipping address. A consignment supports multiple shipping addresses, with each address having its own line items.\\n\\nOrder shipping addresses\\n\\nThe Order Shipping Addresses endpoint allows you to view the shipping addresses on an order. An order can have more than one shipping address.\\n\\nShipping zone and shipping methods\\n\\nYou can configure shipping zones in the control panel or use the API to designate where a merchant ships their products and with which shipping methods should be available in each geographic region.\\n\\nAn example of a shipping zone might be North America. Within that shipping zone, the shipping methods might be Free Shipping, Ship-by-Weight, and USPS.\\n\\nReal-time carriers\\n\\nBigCommerce offers native integrations with many real-time shipping carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. The Shipping Carrier Connection resource allows you to connect an account for one of our natively supported shipping carrier integrations.\\n\\nFor a list of all supported carriers, see Real-Time Quote Providers (opens in a new tab).\\n\\nRelated resources\\n\\nArticles\\n\\nOrders API Overview\\n\\nEndpoints\\n\\nREST Storefront Checkouts API\\n\\nREST Management Checkouts API\\n\\nGraphQL Storefront Carts and Checkout\\n\\nOrder Shipping Addresses\\n\\nShipping v2\\n\\nDid you find what you were looking for?\\n\\nStored payment instruments (Beta) ↗MSF International Enhancements'),\n",

These endpoints are useful when building order management or payment integrations as they make embedding refund functionality directly into the application possible without requiring merchants to return to their BigCommerce control panel.\\n\\nThis article provides an overview of Order\\'s V3 refund capabilities and includes a step-by-step example for creating a single order refund.\\n\\nSingle order refund example\\n\\nRefunding an order consists of two API requests.\\n\\nRequest Operation Endpoint Description 1 POST /v3/orders/{id}/payment_actions/refund_quotes Calculate amounts and get payment methods 2 POST /v3/orders/{id}/payment_actions/refund Create the refund\\n\\nThe example requests in this article use an order with the following properties:\\n\\nProducts: Single product priced at $10.00\\n\\nTax: $0.83\\n\\nShipping: $10.00\\n\\nThe refunded amount will include the shipping, tax, and product cost (a total of $20.83). We will create a refund quote. Then, we will create a refund using the information contained in the create refund quote response.\\n\\nCreating refund quotes\\n\\nA refund quote provides the tax amount, total refund amount, and a list of available payment methods for order refunds.\\n\\nTo create a refund quote, send a POST request to /v3/orders/{order_id}/payment_actions/refund_quotes.\\n\\nExample request: Create a refund quote\\n\\nPOST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/orders/{order_id}/payment_actions/refund_quotes\\nX-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}\\nContent-Type: application/json\\nAccept: application/json\\n \\n{\\n  \"items\": [\\n    {\\n      \"item_type\": \"PRODUCT\",  // Refund a product\\n      \"item_id\": 8,            // Order product ID\\n      \"quantity\": 1,           // Quantity to refund\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"item_type\": \"SHIPPING\", // Refund shipping\\n      \"item_id\": 9,            // Order address ID\\n      \"amount\": 10,            // Amount to refund\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"item_type\": \"ORDER\",    // Tax-exempt order level refund\\n      \"item_id\": 9,            // Order ID\\n      \"amount\": 1,             // Amount to refund\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"item_type\": \"FEE\",     // Refund a fee\\n      \"item_id\": 11,          // Fee ID\\n      \"amount\": 1,            // Amount to refund\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\nTo get an item_id, make a GET request to v2/orders/{order_id}/products.

Marking payments as offline is a way to keep track of which portions of an order you refunded. However, no funds were collected. If you did not receive payment using BigCommerce, then the funds can not be refunded directly to the payment source using BigCommerce\\'s refund endpoints.\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nIs it possible to create a refund without using an item from the order?\\n\\nYes. Set item_type to ORDER and specify an amount to refund. For more information, see create order level refunds.\\n\\nCan I just skip creating the quote and go straight to processing a refund?\\n\\nIt is possible to process a refund without creating a quote first. Quotes serve to make sure you are refunding to the correct payment provider in the correct amount.\\n\\nWhere do I find the item_id?\\n\\nUse the V2 Orders Endpoint to get the required ID:\\n\\nPRODUCT -- Order Product ID\\n\\nGIFT_WRAPPING -- Order Product ID\\n\\nSHIPPING -- Order Address ID\\n\\nHANDLING -- Order Address ID\\n\\nORDER -- Order ID\\n\\nWill this trigger an email to the shopper?\\n\\nYes, if you configure the store to send an email when an order status changes to Refunded or Partially Refunded.\\n\\nHow do I get a list of provider_ids?\\n\\nThe POST Refund Quote exposes provider_ids.\\n\\nWill a refunded item be returned to inventory?\\n\\nNo, you cannot return items to inventory that you refunded via API. You can either update the inventory directly on the product\\'s page or use the Control Panel (opens in a new tab) to change the inventory.\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nYou must receive payment of the order before you can issue a refund.\\n\\nIf you use a payment gateway, it must support refunds. For a list of payment gateways that support refunds through BigCommerce, see the Supported Payment Gateways section in Processing Refunds (opens in a new tab).\\n\\nIf you use a payment gateway, you must settle payments. Some gateways require a certain amount of time to pass before you can process refunds.\\n\\nRelated resources\\n\\nArticles\\n\\nOrders Overview\\n\\nOrder Webhook Events\\n\\nEndpoints\\n\\nOrders V2 Reference\\n\\nOrders V3 Reference\\n\\nDid you find what you were looking for?\\n\\nOverviewCustomizing printed invoices')]"
